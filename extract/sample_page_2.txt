Basic 2-wire Circuit
A voltage output should be converted to current when configuring a ratio metric 4–20mA circuit,
because current-mode applications require a 4mA offset and 16mA span. This section presents the
circuit details and results obtained from a current-loop configuration based on the MAX1459
sensorsignal conditioner. In principle, a voltage regulator is to be added, which converts the 10–32V
loop voltage to a fixed 5V for operating the MAX1459. Figure shows the circuitry required for
implementing a standard ratio metric version of the MAX1459 circuit. The voltage regulator can be
any low-cost device whose quiescent current is sufficiently low for the 4mA budget.

Advantages of 4–20mA Current Loop
Current loops offer four major advantages such as:
– Long-distance transmission without amplitude loss
– Detection of offline sensors, broken transmission lines, and other failures
– Inexpensive 2-wire cables
– Lower EMI sensitivity

RS 232C/RS 485
The RS-232/485 port sequentially sends and receives bytes of information onebit at a time.
Although this method is slower than parallel communication,which allows the transmission of an
entire byte at once, it is simpler and canbe used over longer distances because of lower power
consumption.For example, the IEEE 488 standard for parallel communication states thatthe cable
length between the equipments should not exceed 20m total, witha maximum distance of 2m
