between any two devices. RS-232/485 cabling,however, can extend 1,200m or greater. Typically,
RS-232/485 is used totransmit American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
data.Although National Instruments serial hardware can transmit 7-bit as wellas 8-bit data, most
applications use only 7-bit data. Seven-bit ASCII canrepresent the English alphabet, decimal
numbers, and common punctuationmarks. It is a standard protocol that virtually all hardware and
software understand.Serial communication is mainly using the three transmission lines:
(1) ground, (2) transmit, and (3) receive. Because RS-232/485 communicationis asynchronous, the
serial port can transmit data on one line while receivingdata on another. Other lines such as the
handshaking lines are not required.The important serial characteristics are baud rate, data bits, stop
bits, andparity. To communicate between a serial instrument and a serial port on computer,these
parameters must match.The RS-232 port, or ANSI/EIA-232 port, is the serial connection foundon
IBM-compatible PCs. It is used for many purposes, such as connecting amouse, printer, or modem,
as well as industrial instrumentation. The RS-232protocol can have only one device connected to
each port. The RS-485 (EIA-485 Standard) protocol can have 32 devices connected to each port.
Withthis enhanced multidrop capability the user can create networks of devicesconnected to a single
RS-485 serial port. Noise immunity and multi dropcapability make RS-485, the choice in industrial
applications requiring manydistributed devices networked to a PC or other controller for data
collection.USB was designed primarily to connect peripheral devices to PCs, includingkeyboards,
scanners, and disk drives.RS-232 (Recommended standard-232) is a standard interface approved
bythe Electronic Industries Association (EIA) for connecting serial devices. Inother words, RS-232
is a long established standard that describes the physicalinterface and protocol for relatively low-
speed serial data
