Signal Descriptions
– TxD – This pin carries data from the computer to the serial device
– RXD – This pin carries data from the serial device to the computer
– DTR signals – DTR is used by the computer to signal that it is readyto communicate with the
serial device like modem. In other words, DTRindicates the modem that the DTE (computer) is ON.
– DSR – Similarly to DTR, Data set ready (DSR) is an indication from themodem that it is ON.
– DCD – Data carrier detect (DCD) indicates that carrier for the transmitdata is ON.
– RTS – This pin is used to request clearance to send data to a modem.
– CTS – This pin is used by the serial device to acknowledge the computersRTS signal. In most
situations, RTS and CTS are constantly onthroughout the communication session.
– Clock signals (TC, RC, and XTC) – The clock signals are only used forsynchronous
communications. The modem or DSU extracts the clock fromthe data stream and provides a steady
clock signal to the DTE. Thetransmit and receive clock signals need not have to be the same, or
evenat the same baud rate.
– CD – CD stands for Carrier detect. Carrier detect is used by a modemto signal that it has a made
a connection with another modem, or hasdetected a carrier tone. In other words, this is used by the
modem tosignal that a carrier signal has been received from a remote modem.
RI – RI stands for ring indicator. A modem toggles (keystroke) the stateof this line when an
incoming call rings in the phone. In other words,this is used by an autoanswer modem to signal the
